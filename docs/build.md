# Build instructions

Aeon uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](../Makefile) that
invokes cmake commands as needed.

## Common

* [Install Dependencies](../README.md#dependencies)

* Clone the repository
	Clone recursively to pull-in needed submodule(s):

	`git clone --recursive https://github.com/aeonix/aeon`

	If you already have a repo cloned, initialize and update:
	```
	cd aeon
	git submodule init 
	git submodule update
	```

## On Linux and OS X

* [Install Dependencies](../README.md#dependencies)
* Change to the root of the source code directory, change to the most recent release tag, and build:
	```
        cd aeon
        git checkout v0.12.6.0-aeon
        make
	```
    **Optional**: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable
    parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For
    this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM
    available per thread.

    *Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from
    https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.
    
    *Note*: The instructions above will compile the most stable release of the
    Aeon software. If you would like to use and test the most recent software,
    use `git checkout master`. The master branch may contain updates that are
    both unstable and incompatible with release software, though testing is always 
    encouraged. 

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/aeon/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Aeon with `aeond --detach`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:
	```
        make release-test
	```
    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:
	```
         make debug
	```
* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:
	```
         make release-static
	```
Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):
	```
        HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile
	```
### On Raspberry Pi

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Stretch (2017-09-07 or later) from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/. If you are using Raspian Jessie, [please see note in the following section](#note-for-raspbian-jessie-users). 

* `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software

* Install Aeon [Dependencies](../README.md#dependencies) from the 'Debian' column in the table.

* Increase the system swap size:
```	
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```
* Clone Aeon and checkout most recent release version:
```
        git clone https://github.com/aeonix/aeon.git
	cd aeon
	git checkout tags/v0.12.6.0-aeon
```
* Build:
```
        make release
```
* Wait 4-6 hours

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/aeon/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Aeon with `aeond --detach`

* You may wish to reduce the size of the swap file after the build has finished, and delete the boost directory from your home directory

#### *Note for Raspbian Jessie users*

If you are using the older Raspbian Jessie image, compiling Aeon is a bit more complicated. The version of Boost available in the Debian Jessie repositories is too old to use with Aeon, and thus you must compile a newer version yourself. The following explains the extra steps, and has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Jessie.

* As before, `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software, and increase the system swap size

```	
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```

* Then, install the dependencies for Aeon except `libunwind` and `libboost-all-dev`

* Install the latest version of boost (this may first require invoking `apt-get remove --purge libboost*` to remove a previous version if you're not using a clean install):
```
	cd  
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	tar xvfo boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	cd boost_1_64_0  
	./bootstrap.sh  
	sudo ./b2  
```
* Wait ~8 hours
```
	sudo ./bjam install
```
* Wait ~4 hours

* From here, follow the [general Raspberry Pi instructions](#on-the-raspberry-pi) from the "Clone Aeon and checkout most recent release version" step.

## On Windows

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](http://msys2.github.io). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](http://msys2.github.io), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4  
* Edit the properties for the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut changing "msys2_shell.bat" to "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64" for 64-bit builds or "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32" for 32-bit builds
* Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  


* Install dependencies:

    To build for 64-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium

    To build for 32-bit Windows:
 
        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium

* Open the MingW shell via `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.

**Cloning**

* To git clone, run:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/aeonix/aeon.git

**Building**

* Change to the cloned directory, run:
	
        cd aeon

* If you would like a specific [version/tag](https://github.com/aeonix/aeon/tags), do a git checkout for that version. eg. 'v0.12.6.0-aeon'. If you dont care about the version and just want binaries from master, skip this step:
	
        git checkout v0.12.6.0-aeon

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win64

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 64-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win64
	
* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 32-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/debug/bin`

## On FreeBSD

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Linux above. If you are running Aeon in a jail you need to add the flag: `allow.sysvipc=1` to your jail configuration, otherwise lmdb will throw the error message: `Failed to open lmdb environment: Function not implemented`.

We expect to add Aeon into the ports tree in the near future, which will aid in managing installations using ports or packages.

## On OpenBSD

### OpenBSD < 6.2

This has been tested on OpenBSD 5.8.

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add db cmake gcc gcc-libs g++ miniupnpc gtest`.

The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set.

The Boost package has a bug that will prevent librpc.a from building correctly. In order to fix this, you will have to Build boost yourself from scratch. Follow the directions here (under "Building Boost"):
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md

You will have to add the serialization, date_time, and regex modules to Boost when building as they are needed by Aeon.

To build: `env CC=egcc CXX=eg++ CPP=ecpp DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/the/boost/you/built make release-static-64`

### OpenBSD >= 6.2

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add cmake miniupnpc zeromq libiconv`.

The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set.


Build the Boost library using clang. This guide is derived from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md

We assume you are compiling with a non-root user and you have `doas` enabled.

Note: do not use the boost package provided by OpenBSD, as we are installing boost to `/usr/local`.

```

Build cppzmq

Build the cppzmq bindings.

We assume you are compiling with a non-root user and you have `doas` enabled.

```
# Create cppzmq building directory
mkdir ~/cppzmq
cd ~/cppzmq

# Fetch cppzmq source
ftp -o cppzmq-4.2.3.tar.gz https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/archive/v4.2.3.tar.gz

tar xfz cppzmq-4.2.3.tar.gz

# Start building cppzmq
cd cppzmq-4.2.3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
doas make install
```

Build Aeon: `env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make release-static`

## On Solaris

The default Solaris linker can't be used, you have to install GNU ld, then run cmake manually with the path to your copy of GNU ld:

        mkdir -p build/release
        cd build/release
        cmake -DCMAKE_LINKER=/path/to/ld -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
        cd ../..

Then you can run make as usual.

## On Linux for Android (using docker)

**TODO: Needs confirmation!**

        # Build image (select android64.Dockerfile for aarch64)
        cd utils/build_scripts/ && docker build -f android32.Dockerfile -t aeon-android .
        # Create container
        docker create -it --name aeon-android aeon-android bash
        # Get binaries
        docker cp aeon-android:/opt/android/aeon/build/release/bin .

# Building portable statically linked binaries

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:

* ```make release-static-linux-x86_64``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-i686``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv8``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv7``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv6``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
* ```make release-static-win64``` builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
* ```make release-static-win32``` builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems
